                <h2>Work</h2>
                <p>As a devoted father of four delightful daughters, I'm a tech enthusiast with a diverse
                    background in entrepreneurship and a passion for learning. My professional journey started over
                    two
                    decades ago in the retail industry, where I gained expertise in human resource and data-driven
                    management, account and assortment management, stakeholder collaboration, and customer service.
                    I'm
                    also an avid learner who is currently exploring the vast world of artificial intelligence and
                    coding
                    to find more efficient ways of working.</br></br>My professional journey commenced when I was a
                    seventeen-year-old college student and was discovered right outside the doorstep of my family's
                    apartment. From the bottle and cart boy in the beginning to present work as a K-retailer
                    entrepreneur I have done all the different jobs in a grocery store one possibly
                    can.</br></br>Throughout my career I have had the privilege of working with numerous superiors
                    and collaborators and with two different K-retailers. These opportunities have enabled me to
                    develop the expertise to work effectively with various individuals and teams. As an entrepreneur
                    for over a decade, I have gained invaluable experience in leading both employees and teams. Some
                    of my key entrepreneurial qualities include the ability to withstand stress, make swift
                    decisions and work with a solution-based approach.</br></br>When I started in the retail
                    industry in February 1997, ordering and assortment management were mostly manual - orders were
                    made by calling and the quantity was always decided by the purchaser. However, at that time,
                    there were already portable devices available that transmitted orders electronically to
                    suppliers.</br></br>The operations of the retail industry inevitably began to utilize more
                    information technology, and soon we were able to enjoy the first time when orders were made by
                    the machine. However this had nothing to do with artificial intelligence - the algorithms were
                    simple at that time.</br></br>It has always been easy for me to adopt information technology as
                    part of my daily work. I have been interested in what can be found under the hood of an
                    application or a system - why something works the way it does. Nowadays, most of our tools are
                    cloud based and are used on
                    mobile devices or computers. As part of my studies, I did an internship in the Kesko artificial
                    intelligence unit and after studying the Python programming language used by the unit day and
                    night, I eventually managed to code somewhat independently. Today, a small part of the code in
                    the assortment management application used by every K-food store was written by me.</p>

            <div id="mainstudies" class="display-none">
                <h2>Studies</h2>
                <p>I have always loved different kind of systems, computers and gadgets. The
                    desire to find out what
                    is the logic behind them and the fast growing digitalization in the field of grocery trade -
                    especially inside K group - drove me to apply to LAB University of Applied Sciences. After
                    passing the entrance exams I found myself studying to become an engineer of information and
                    communication technology. All the studies were remote studies and I have studied little less
                    than two years. It was of course sometimes a bit hard to combine work, studies and family life.
                    </br> </br>Recent global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have
                    impacted business operations in a way that required me to be more involved in my company's work.
                    The second year of studies was also more intense than the first and it began to be difficult to
                    study efficiently while working - however, it is always important to remember what brings bread
                    to the table. I had to put my studies on hold, but I have continued to study independently
                    through online courses. I have taken all the possible free moments to study. I have acquired
                    many courses from internet to advance the studies taken in school and many topics outside the
                    school courses.</br> </br>Currently I am studying the Elements of AI online course created by
                    the University of Helsinki and MinnaLearn. I have already completed the first part of the course
                    - Introduction to AI - and now I am working on the second part of the course, Building AI. I
                    studied online courses for Python programming language and SQL databases once more to facilitate
                    the completion of the Elements of AI course. </br> </br>The release of ChatGPT for public use in
                    late 2022 made the world realize just how advanced AI models have become. My interest in AI led
                    me to learn more about the topic beyond just reading news headlines, and our first encounter
                    extended into the late hours of the night. Even my studies and fascination with systems and
                    computers did not prepare me for what I discovered. In that moment I realized that this was
                    something that would change the world significantly. From that moment on I have been slowly
                    studying and testing what ChatGPT is capable of. The next step through ChatGPT of course was to
                    start learning about how GitHub Copilot can help me in my coding. It was clear that in order to
                    use artificial intelligence you must have a foundational understanding of the subject matter to
                    which you are applying AI. Otherwise you cannot critically examine the solution options provided
                    by the AI.</br> </br> My current goal is to combine the knowledge I have gained from both my
                    studies and hobbies to achieve more efficient ways of working - for example I spend a lot of
                    time at work going through large amounts of data to manage assortment. By coding a bit I could
                    automate these everyday tasks and in the end even let artificial intelligence perform them.</p>
