          <h2>Work</h2>
          <p>
            I am a devoted father of four lovely daughters and a tech enthusiast
            with a diverse background in entrepreneurship and a passion for
            learning. My professional journey started over two decades ago in
            the retail industry, where I gained expertise in human resource and
            data-driven management, account and assortment management,
            stakeholder collaboration, and customer service - not forgetting
            marketing. I'm also an avid learner who is studying to master the
            art of coding. I'm trying to find the ways to develop myself more
            and -why not- completely new profession.<br /><br />My professional
            journey commenced when I was a seventeen-year-old college student
            and was discovered right outside the doorstep of my family's
            apartment. From the bottle and cart boy in the beginning to present
            work as a K-retailer entrepreneur I have done all the different jobs
            in a grocery store one possibly can.<br /><br />Throughout my career
            I have had the privilege of working with numerous superiors and
            collaborators and with two different K-retailers. These
            opportunities have enabled me to develop the expertise to work
            effectively with various individuals and teams. As an entrepreneur
            for over a decade, I have gained invaluable experience in leading
            both employees and teams. Some of my key entrepreneurial qualities
            include the ability to withstand stress, make swift decisions and
            work with a solution-based approach.<br /><br />When I started in
            the retail industry in February 1997, ordering and assortment
            management were mostly manual - orders were made by calling and the
            quantity was always decided by the purchaser. However, at that time,
            there were already portable devices available that transmitted
            orders electronically to suppliers.<br /><br />The operations of the
            retail industry inevitably began to utilize more information
            technology, and soon we were able to enjoy the first time when
            orders were made by the machine. However this had nothing to do with
            artificial intelligence - the algorithms were simple at that
            time.<br /><br />Currently, my career as a K-retailer has reached a
            point where, due to the termination of the lease for the second
            store's premises at the end of this year, it is difficult to sustain
            my livelihood meaningfully with just one store. Therefore, I've
            started to look for new job opportunities. It would be convenient
            and pleasant to be able to combine the experience gained as an
            entrepreneur with studies/hobbies, such as coding.

          <h2>Studies</h2>
          <p>
            It has always been easy for me to adopt information technology as
            part of my daily work. I have been interested in what can be found
            under the hood of an application or a system - why something works
            the way it does. Nowadays, most of our tools are cloud based and are
            used on mobile devices or computers.<br /><br />
            I have always loved different kind of systems, computers and
            gadgets. The desire to find out what is the logic behind them and
            the fast growing digitalization in the field of grocery trade -
            especially inside K group - drove me to apply to LAB University of
            Applied Sciences. After passing the entrance exams I found myself
            studying to become an engineer of information and communication
            technology. All the studies are remote studies and I have studied
            little less than two years. It is of course sometimes a bit hard to
            combine work, studies and family life. With good time management,
            even that can be accomplished.<br />
            <br />The war in Ukraine impacted business operations in a way that
            required me to be more involved in my company's work. The second
            year of studies was also more intense than the first and it began to
            be difficult to study efficiently while working. I had to put my
            studies on hold, but I have continued to study independently with
            the courses I obtained from the internet.<br />
            <br />
            As part of my studies, I did an internship in the Kesko artificial
            intelligence unit and after studying the Python programming language
            used by the unit day and night, I eventually managed to code
            somewhat independently. Today, a small part of the code in the
            assortment management application used by every K-food store was
            written by me.<br />I have returned to school and new semester will
            start at the beginning of August 2024.<br />
            <br />The release of ChatGPT for public use in late 2022 made the
            world realize just how advanced AI models have become. My interest
            in AI led me to learn more about the topic beyond just reading news
            headlines, and our first encounter extended into the late hours of
            the night. Even my studies and fascination with systems and
            computers did not prepare me for what I discovered. In that moment I
            realized that this was something that would change the world
            significantly. From that moment on I have been slowly studying and
            testing what ChatGPT is capable of. The next step through ChatGPT of
            course was to start learning about how GitHub Copilot can help me in
            my coding. It was clear that in order to use artificial intelligence
            you must have a foundational understanding of the subject matter to
            which you are applying AI. Otherwise you cannot critically examine
            the solution options provided by the AI.

          <h2>Interests</h2>
          <p>
            Reading: I enjoy escaping between the lines of short stories and
            novels. Some of my favorite authors are Richard K. Morgan, Patrick
            Rothfuss, William Gibson, Tom Clancy, and Stephen King. I find it
            fascinating to explore different worlds and characters through their
            writing. Along with fiction, I also like to read non-fiction books
            about information and communication technologies. It's a great way
            to keep up with the latest trends and advancements in the field.<br /><br />
            Outdoors: My wife and I enjoy exploring the great outdoors - on foot
            or on our fat bikes or on horseback. We love to discover new trails
            and take in the beauty of nature. I'm also a bit of a photography
            enthusiast and have used my drone and gopro to capture some
            incredible shots of our fat bike rides. It's an amazing feeling to
            see the world from a different perspective.<br /><br />
            Home automation: I enjoy tinkering with automation and have
            automated many aspects of our home using Home Assistant. It's been a
            fun and rewarding hobby that has also made our lives easier and more
            efficient.<br /><br />
            Coding: In my free time, I enjoy coding as a hobby. I love the
            challenge of solving problems and creating something from scratch.
            It's a great way to exercise my brain and keep my skills sharp.
